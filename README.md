# jVMC
This is an impementation of Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) for quantum many-body dynamics using the [JAX library](https://jax.readthedocs.io "JAX library") (and [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io "FLAX library") on top) to exploit the blessings of automatic differentiation for easy model composition and just-in-time compilation for execution on accelerators.
